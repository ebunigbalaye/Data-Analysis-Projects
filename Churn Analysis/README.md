# Subscription Churn & Retention Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn for a subscription-based telecom company to identify service, geographic, and engagement factors that influence customer retention.
The analysis focuses on understanding which customer segments are most likely to churn and translating those findings into actionable business recommendations.

## Dataset
 **Source:** Telco Customer Churn dataset (public sample dataset)
 **Grain:** One row per customer
 **Key Fields:**
  - Customer demographics and service subscriptions
  - Internet and add-on services (e.g. online security)
  - Marketing offer acceptance
  - Location (city)
  - Tenure and churn status


## Objectives
Measure overall customer churn
Identify services associated with higher churn rates
Detect geographic concentrations of churn
Understand the relationship between marketing engagement and churn
Provide data-driven recommendations to improve retention



## Analysis Approach
Performed data validation and cleaning to ensure consistency
Created customer segments based on service usage, geography, and engagement
Calculated churn rates using PivotTables
Ranked cities by number of churned customers
Built a churn and retention dashboard to visualize key patterns



## Key Insights
Customers without online security services* churned at significantly higher rates than those with online security enabled.
Churn was geographically concentrated, San Diego, California accounting for a the highest share of customer cancellations.
Customers who did not accept any marketing offers were the most likely to churn, suggesting low engagement as a strong churn indicator.


## Recommendations
Bundle or promote online security services during onboarding to improve retention.
Prioritize high-churn cities for targeted retention efforts and service quality reviews.
Flag customers who ignore all marketing offers as high-risk and target them with personalized retention campaigns.
